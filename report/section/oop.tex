\section{Object Oriented Programming}
\subsection{Abstraction}
Use of abstraction can be seen in the ``Vector'' abstract class.
This class defines how all vectors should work and the interface through which you convert them into a Java AWT shape.
\subsection{Encapsulation}
An example of Encapsulation can be seen in the ``Pen'' class.
In this class, the Color of the object is hidden.
It can only be accessed through the getter method, and can only set through the constructor as an argument and through the setter method.
\subsection{Inheritance}
Inheritance is used in the ``ToolBar'' class. It inherits from the ``JToolBar'' class.
\subsection{Polymorphism}
Polymorphism can be seen in the ``App'' class. It both inherits from a ``JFrame'' and implements the ``KeyListener'' interface.
As such, it is both a ``JFrame'' and a ``KeyListener''.
